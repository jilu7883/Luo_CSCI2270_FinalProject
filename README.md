# Luo_CSCI2270_FinalProject

       My project is an externsion for the binary tree.The project have ability to left rotate, right rotate, mirror and it can pretty print which easier for user to see what have change. It will help people to understand how all these function works. 
       When you run this program, you can run the program by inserting the file(I have a file call "Finalwool purchase" to put into the file), and also can insert the product individually.
